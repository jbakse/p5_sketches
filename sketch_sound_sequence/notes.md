# Music Theory

I don't have a great deal of knowledge around music theory, so it is possible that some of the following may be incorrect. Still, these are the assumptions I used in creating the examples we will study this week.

Assumptions:
- A piece of music is an organized collection of notes and rests.
- A note is a tonal sound defined by it's pitch, length, loudness, and timber.
- A rest is a period of silence defined by it's length.

Pitches:
- The pitches of musical notes are constrained to a repeating, exponential 12 note grid.
- Each note in the grid is 2^1/12 or 1.059 times higher than the last.
- After 12 notes the pitch will double, this is called and octave.
- These notes are named ["C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B"]
- You could also call "C#" "D-Flat". They are the same thing. Except when they are totally not.
- The distance between two adjacent notes is called a half-step. Two half-steps is a whole-step.
- The fourth octave "A" note is often used as a tuning standard, and is often set at 440hz.
- Side Note: 12 steps is a compromise that allows each step to be equal, but results in intervals between pitches that are close to integer ratios.  

Scales:
- You could use all of the notes when writing music, but most music picks a subset of notes to stick too.
- These subsets of notes are called keys.
- Keys have a tonic, which is the note that the key is built from.
- Keys have a scale, which describes the intervals from the tonic to the other notes in the scale.
- For example the major scale intervals are [whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half]
- So, C Major is C, then two half-steps up, two half-steps up, one half-step up, etc.
- There are very many different scales. Major and minor are pretty common.
- The mood of music is tied to the scales. Major is happy. Minor is sad. It is kind of crazy.

Rhythm:


- Rhythm
- 4/4 time
- beats per measure
